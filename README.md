## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a simple and fun game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Pig Game is a two-player game where the goal is to be the first player to reach a specified winning score. Players take turns rolling a dice, and they accumulate points based on the roll. However, they must be careful not to roll a 1, or they will lose all their accumulated points for that turn. The game requires both luck and strategy to win.

## 2. How to Play
1. **Gameplay:**
   - Players take turns rolling the dice by clicking the "Roll Dice" button.
   - Each roll accumulates points in the current score for the active player.
   - If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current score, and it becomes the other player's turn.
   - To save the current score and add it to their total score, a player can click the "Hold" button.
